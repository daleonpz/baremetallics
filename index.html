    Hi! 
    <br> <br>
    Welcome to <b>Baremetallics.com</b>.
    <br> <br>
    We, just like you, want to learn more about embedded systems and keep mastering our craft.
    <br> <br>
    But, over months or years, we faced the frustration of reading not at all easy to understand tutorials or books.<br><br>
    Just to mention some...
    <br><br>

    <h3>Problem 1: Abuse of passive voice:</h3><br>
    Please read the following sentences.<br><br>
    1) "This feature <b>CAN BE USED</b> to read the contents of a characteristic value by using its handle."
    <br>
    2) "With this feature <b>you can use</b> characteristic's handle to read its the contents."
    <br><br>
    Which one was easier for you to understand?
    <br><br>
    The number 2, right? <br><br>

    The reason is that in the passive voice we aren't sure who or what is doing the action. That's why it's easier to understand sentences in the active voice.
    <br><br>


    <h3>Problem 2: Knowledge gaps:</h3><br>
    Imagine this situation. You were installing an update on your laptop but suddenly your battery run out of battery and your laptop shut down.
    <br><br>
    When you turned it on you read the following message:<br>
    <code>error: file /boot/vmlinuz-5.1-x86_64 not found</code><br><br>

    The next thing you do is google the error. You ended up one forum that tells you<br><br>
    <center>You have to chroot your system and from there you mount your kernel image"  <br>
        -- somebody in manjaro forum -- </center>

    <br><br>

    It's a good answer. But you are still not sure what you need to do because you don't know what <code>chroot</code> is. Or you don't know how to find your kernel image or how to mount it.
    <br><br> 
    
    And... let's be honest <br><br>
    When we google our problem we expect a step-by-step or how-to answer. 
    <br><br>
    For example, it would have been cooler if that guy would have written a summary of this 
    <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-rescue-non-booting-grub-2-linux/">post</a> or at least added also the link to it. 
    <br><br>
