    Embedded Systems are cool and fun. And more than anything else, easy.<br><br>
    But it's a sad fact that most of the content is not easy to process. 
    Specially for a beginner.<br><br> 
    We are a community that strives to spread knowledge. <br>
    Our goal is to make our content as easy as possible to understand. <br><br>
    We don't want you to decipher tutorials, guides or books to learn what's in them.
