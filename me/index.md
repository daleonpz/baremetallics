Hi ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ,  

My name is Daniel. An old computer and good internet connection is what I have. 
Eclipse, in my opinion, is a big piece of shit. I just wanted to say it ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ 

I started this blog to journal my learning process. 
As a note, I'll try to describe everything I learn as simple and direct as possible. Because I am stupid and I think the rest of the people are too. 

Read my last [post]({% for post in site.categories.randomthought limit: 1%}{{ post.url }}   {% endfor %}).

Enjoy this day!
