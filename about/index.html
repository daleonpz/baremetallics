    <p>
    Embedded Systems are cool and fun. And more than anything else, easy.<br><br>
    But it's a sad fact that most of the content/information out there is not easy to process. <br>
    Specially for a beginner.<br><br> 
    We are a community that wants to spread knowledge. <br>
    <b>Our goal is to make our content as easy as possible to understand.</b> <br><br>
    We don't want you to decipher tutorials, guides or books to learn.
