## About Us - Why we care
Embedded Systems are cool and fun. And more than anything else, easy.

But it's a sad fact that most of the content/information out there is not easy to process.
Specially for a beginner.

We are a community that wants to spread knowledge.
**Our goal is to make our content as easy as possible to understand.**

We don't want you to decipher tutorials, guides or books to learn.
